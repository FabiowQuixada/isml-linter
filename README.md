### Before you start 
Make sure that, before running any command, you set the "rootTemplate" property in the config.json file. This is the directory where the linter will look for ISML files to run over. There is a default example there, so just follow the same pattern :)


### Adding a Rule
To add a new rule, simply add a correponding js file to the rules/ directory, following the same conventions of other rules. The new rule will apply automatically, no extra configuration needed. Make sure the file name ends in "(...)Rule.js".


### Testing a Rule
To test a rule, place a (name of the rule)Spec.js file under spec/rules/ directory. It will know what rule to refer to based on the file name, so make sure there are no typos.
